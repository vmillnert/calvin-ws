#
#   Set the IMEI as a property of the application instance
#     A generic call to some POST method matches the 'emei' key to the application and sets the parameter 'cellid' on the application.
#    Trigger a deployment decision and the 'cellid' will match a new cell. DC must somehow also be in the list.
